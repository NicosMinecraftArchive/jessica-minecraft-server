# Nightime mob spawning tables (also does not affect the nexus)
# A spawnpool contains things that can possibly spawn, depending on a random chance or something else.
# Example: First entry is Zombie and 3.0 probability weight. Second entry is Spider and 1.0 weight.
# Zombies would spawn 75% of the time and spiders 25% of the time
